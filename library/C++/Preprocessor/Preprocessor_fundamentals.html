<h1> Preprocessor Fundamentals  </h1>
</center>

<p>
The C or C++ preprocessor is used as a means of transforming the input to the
compiler.
There are three common purposes for the preprocessor, though the preprocessor
is a fairly general purpose language.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Including header files as part of a file </li>
<li> Conditional compilation </li>
<li> Macros, which transform symbols </li>
</ul>

<h2> Header files </h2>

<p>
A header file is a file with source code in it, though generally
header files include definitions of data and descriptions of functions.
In C the header files generally have ".h" as am extension, though this is not
required.
The pattern for C++ is to have header files with no extension.
Below is a common preprocessor statement to include C++ source code from
a header file.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
</pre>

<h2> Conditional compilation </h2>

<p>
Conditional compilation means either including some code or skipping it
in a file.
The following statement is a common pattern:
</p>

<pre>
#ifndef SOMETHING
#define SOMETHING
...
#endif
</pre>

<p>
The test means "if not defined", so if the macro named SOMETHING is not
defined the code represented by "..." is included in the compilation.
If SOMETHING is defined the code is skipped.
The pattern is used over and over and is called a "header guard".
It makes it possible for a particular header file to be included several times
during a compilation, but the code will be skipped for all inclusions
after the first.
</p>

<h2> Macros </h2>

<p>
A macro is defined with the "#define" preprocessor command.
A macro can be used as with the header guard for simply indicating that
is defined.
A macro can also define a translation.
In the simplest case a macro has no parameters and allows a text 
substitution to be done:
</p>

<pre>
#define N 100
</pre>

<p>
From that point forward the "identifier" N will be replace with 100.
This can be useful for symbolic constants, though C++ has some
better techniques.
</p>

<p>
The macro defined next has w parameters and allows a more complex
form of text substitution.
</p>

<pre>
#define AVG(a,b,c) ((a+b+c)/3.0)
</pre>

<p>
With this macro AVG(x,y,z) would be replaced by ((x+y+z)/3.0).
