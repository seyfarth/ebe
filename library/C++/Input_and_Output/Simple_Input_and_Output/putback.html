//  The putback function is predefined in iostream. Its 
//  purpose is to replace one character at a time to the 
//  input buffer. Your code will look like this:

	cin.putback(ch);

//  After execution of the above line, whatever character 
//  was in ch is placed back onto the front end of the 
//  input buffer, and will be the next character to be 
//  read from it.

//  The putback function might be used with cin to strip 
//  whitespace from the input buffer, like this:

	cin >> ch;
	cin.putback(ch);

//  Recall that the cin stream extraction operator (>>) 
//  ignores tabs, spaces, and new lines, so the input buffer 
//  might look like this before the above two lines are 
//  executed:

	|' ' ' ' ' 			//  spaces
	|' ' 'A'			//  new line and spaces 

//  It will look like this after:

	'A'
