//  Cin makes use of the stream extraction operator, >>, to accept
//  input from the input stream buffer, placing it into a memory 
//  location that is referenced by the identifier (variable name) 
//  placed after the stream extraction operator. The basic format 
//  looks like this in your code:

int a;
double x;
char ch;
string str;

cin >> a;

cin >> x;

cin >> ch;

cin >> str;

//  A cout is always used to prompt users of your program to enter 
//  the appropriate data. Thus, every cin above should be preceded 
//  by a cout, like this:

cout << "Enter an integer here:  " << endl;
cin >> a;

//  More than one input can be accomplished by a cin statement. In 
//  such a case, the user prompt should include explicit instructions 
//  as to the type and order of the inputs. For instance, in the 
//  following code,

cout << "Enter an integer value, followed by a space," 
	<< "then a double value. Be sure to press <ENTER>.  ";
cin >> a >> x;

//  Without explicit instructions, your user might enter the values 
//  with no space between. this would result in values like, perhaps, 
//  46 and 57.9 to become 4,657 and 0.9 as placed into a and x 
//  respectively, instead of the intended values.
