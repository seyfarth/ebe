 Input and Output with stdin and stdout
</h1>
</center>

<p>
Basic input and output to your monitor and from your keyboard is essential
to your programs. How else, at the beginning, are you going to get parameters 
and data into, and results out of, your program? The iostream header file is 
included in all Ebe templates to include basic input and output functions like 
cin, cout, get, peek, putback and ignore. The include statement looks like this: 
</p>

<pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note the absence of a semicolon at the end of this statement. Iostream makes 
use of the std namespace, so the following line must also be part of the basic
file template:
</p>

<pre>
    using namespace std; 
</pre>

<p>
Now we can use cin and cout to input data to our programs and output results. 
Get, peek, putback, ignore, and clear are also available via iostream. Example 
code snippets for these I/O functions are available within this section. The 
basic cout/ cin pair for a user prompt for input looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
   cout &lt;&lt; "Type in a value for degrees in Fahrenheit, then press enter:  " &lt;&lt; endl;
   cin &gt;&gt; fahrDegrees;
</pre>

<p>
Note the stream insertion operator <code><<</code> in the cout statement and the 
<code>endl</code>. The <code><<</code> means, in this context, means <i>place this 
token into the output stream.</i> In this case, a literal sentence then a new line. The 
stream extraction operator, <code>>></code>, from the cin statement, accepts the 
next token from the input stream (the keyboard, at this point), that corresponds to 
the variable, presumably declared above, fahrDegrees. The effect of the cin statement 
is that the keyboard input is read from the input buffer, where the keyboard placed it, 
and placed in the memory location pointed to by the variable name, fahrDegrees.
<p>

<p>
Additional functions, mentioned above, can perform many tasks with the input and 
output streams. These functions are capable of getting a single character, putting 
items back into the input buffer, looking ahead into it, ignoring portions of the 
input, and clearing the stream if an error occurs. Code snippets for all of these 
are included in the accompanying files. More specific cin and cout snippets can be 
found there, too.
</p>

<p>
I/O formatting is addressed in another set of code snippets. The ability to manipulate 
output to organize it into more readable formats is part of the header file 
<i>iomanip</i>. Iomanip provides the ability to set decimal places displayed, set display 
field widths, set justifications, and much more. This header file has an entire section 
dedicated to it.
