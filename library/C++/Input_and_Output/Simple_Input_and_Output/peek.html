//  The peek function is predefined in iostream. Its 
//  purpose is to read one character at a time 
//  from the input buffer, without removing the content
//  of the buffer. Your code will look like this:

	ch = cin.peek();

//  Note the lack of parameters within the parentheses as 
//  compared to other cin functions like get or ignore.

//  After its execution, the only change will be that ch 
//  now contains the first character from the input buffer. 
//  Thde buffer itself is unaffected, containing exactly the 
//  sequence of characters it held before the peek was 
//  executed. This can be useful for tasks like making input 
//  based decisions during execution. Peek might be used in 
//  the following code to handle input appropriately and 
//  avoid stream error conditions brought about by improper 
//  assignment of stream inputs.

	int num;
	char ch, ch1;

	ch = cin.peek;
	if ('0' <= ch && ch <= '9')
	  cin >> num;
	else cin(ch1);

//  In this case, we are unsure of the type of the next input 
//  in the buffer, so we use peek to test it and read it into 
//  memory according to the test, 
//  	if ('0' <= ch && ch <= '9') 
//  which tests to determine if the next character is a digit 
//  or a character. Aftedr this test, the appropriate cin 
//  statement is called.
