//  The ignore function is predefined in iostream. Its 
//  purpose is simply to ignore, one character at 
//  a time, any input defined in its call statement 
//  defined as ignorable by position or type.from the 
//  input buffer. This means your program can ignore 
//  white space one character at a time, or perhaps all
//  white space besides new line characters, just tabs, 
//  or any other useful combination. Your program might 
//  also ignore all numeric or nun numeric input, or 
//  perhaps accept only input within predefined ranges.
//  Given an input buffer that looks like this:

	25 67 48 19
	13 579 10 38

//  Your code might look like this:

	cin >> a;
	cin.ignore(100, '\n');
	cin >> b;

//  This code reads the first input from each line of
//  input, discarding the remainder from each line of
//  buffer input. Another sequence might be:

	25 67 48 19     //  comments here
	13 579 10 38    //  comments here

	while(cin.ignore(100, '/')){
	  cin.ignore(100, '/');
	  while(cin.get(ch))
	    cout << ch;
	  cout << endl;
	}

//  This code will output only the comments from the 
//  input, displaying them on the monitor. Ignore() 
//  is used to bypass delimiters and other content.
