//  The get function is predefined in iostream. Its 
//  purpose is simply to retrieve one character at 
//  a time from the input buffer, white space and all.
//  Get does not skip white space, like the stream 
//  extraction operator, but lets the programmer 
//  handle it instead. This is important if the structure
//  of the input file must be maintained. Recall that cin, 
//  with the stream extraction operator, will skip not 
//  just spaces, but tabs and new lines, leaving all input 
//  essentially on one line. Cin.get() can be used to 
//  capture that information. In your codde, it will look 
//  like this:

	cin.get(ch);

//  By itself, this does not seem helpful, but combining 
//  it with other elements, like a while loop, we might 
//  create a structure like this:

	while (cin.get(ch))
	  if (ch == ' ' || ch == '\t' || ch == '\n')
	    cout << ch;
	  else{
	    cout << ch;
	    stringArray[counter] = ch;
	    counter++;
	  }

//  This structure echos input contents to the screen while 
//  saving the non white space content to a character array, 
//  presumably for some later processing. Despite its simple 
//  nature, cin.get() has many such practical uses.
