Formatted Output
</h1>
</center>

<p>
Formatted output to your monitor or to a file, from your program is important, 
especially when the presentation of your results is more easily understood by 
your user with some form of organization. For example, if your program tabulates 
a loan payment program by monthly payments, including a new principal amount, 
interest paid, payment amount, and the number of the payment, it would aid the 
user of the program if these values were presented in consistent, aligned columns. 
Further, such a program deals with dollar amounts, so consistently showing two 
decimal points of precision, even if this means displaying trailing zeroes, is 
preferable.
</p>

<p>
C++ provides for formated output for these situations, via manipulators. You have 
used some of these manipulators, like <code>endl</code>, already. Others, like 
<code>setprecision()</code> or <code>fixed></code> are presented here. Besides 
instructing the preprocessor to include the <i>iostream</i> header file, you will 
need to include the <i>iomanip</i> header file for the manipulators that require 
parameters, like setfill(). Include <i>iomanip</i> at the top of your source file 
like this: 
</p>

<pre>
	#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <code>setprecision(n)</code> manipulator does what its name implies. It sets 
the maximum number of decimal places displayed by cout to the parameter following 
its call in parentheses. Since it is used as a manipulator with <code>cout</code> and 
the stream insertion operator, it must be used like this:
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(2);
</pre>

<p>
Since the value within the parentheses is 2, the output following this statement will 
display at most two decimal places, whether or not this value is rounded from several 
decimal places of precision. Don't forget to include <code>iomamip</code> when using 
setprecision().
</p>

<p>
The <code>fixed</code> manipulator sets the output of the cout statements following it in your 
program to fixed decimal format. It will force cout to display the six default decimal 
places specified in cout, or another number of places, specified in your code. Use it in 
your code like this:
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; fixed;
</pre>

<p>
The <code>scientific</code> manipulator forces cout to display expressions in scientific notation. 
So a number like 354.79 would be displayed as 3.547900e+002. Like <code>fixed, scientific</code> 
has no parameter and does not require <code>iomanip</code>. It will look like this in your code:
<p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; scientific;
</pre>

<p>
The <code>showpoint</code> manipulator forces cout to display the decimal point and trailing 
zeroes, whether the value returned by the expression is sufficiently precise or not. This 
is useful for keeping columns aligned and representing data uniformly. It will look like 
this in your source code:
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; showpoint;
</pre>

<p>
Often <code>showpoint</code> is used in conjunction with the <code>fixed</code> manipulator. This 
collaboration will result in a set representation of a group of values. So combining these 
two with, for instance, <code>setprecision(2)</code> will do nicley to display a column or several 
columns of dollar amounts, like the following example demonstrates.
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; fixed &lt;&lt; showpoint;
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(2);
	for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
		cout &lt;&lt; "\tPayment " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " reduces principal amount to:  " &lt;&lt; principal &lt;&lt; endl;
</pre>

<p>
The <code>setw(n)</code> manipulator sets the width of the field in which the next expression 
is displayed. Unlike <code>setprecision()</code>, which must be unset, <code>setw()</code> 
applies only to the next field. So to specify a column width in which to print a value, 
<code>setw(n)</code>, where n is the number of spaces dedicated to the value, within the line, 
is the best choice. In your code it will look like this: 
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; x;
</pre>

<p>
Extra spaces generated by the <code>setw(n)</code> mamipulator, not taken by the expression, 
are, by default, displayed as spaces to the left of the right-justified expression. In most 
cases, this is acceptable. We can use the ostream manipulator <code>setfill(ch)</code> to 
fill this space with an alternative character to the space. The character value held in 
<i>ch</i>, be it '#', '$', '&', '-', or any other printable ASCII character, even letters 
or numbers, will then be used in lieu of the space, ' ', to fill the excess space in the 
field. When combined with <code>setw(n)</code> in your code, it will look like this:
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; setfill('%');
	cout &lt;&lt; setw(10) &lt;&lt; x;
</pre>


<p>
The <code>left</code> manipulator justifies a width adjusted expression to the left of the 
field. In essence it left justifies everything following it until it is unset or overridden. 
Since it has no parameter, it is part of the <code>iostream</code> header file, and is an 
ostream variable manipulator. It will look like this in your code:
</p>

<pre>
	cout &lt;&lt; left;
	cout &lt;&lt; setfill('%');
	cout &lt;&lt; setw(10) &lt;&lt; x;
</pre>

<p>
As you might guess, <code>right</code> behaves like <code>left</code>. In the above example, 
<i>x</i> will be printed on the left side of the field, with <i>'%'</i> filling in the 
spaces to the right. If <code>left</code> were changed to <code>right</code>, the value would 
be printed to the right of the established field with the percent signs to the left.
</p>

<p>
To undo changes made to the default print scheme use <code>unsetf()</code>. It's syntax is 
shown below:
</p>

<pre>
	cout.unsetf(ios::left);
</pre>
