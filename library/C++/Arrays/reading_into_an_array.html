//
//  You frequently need to read into an array using cin and you can't be
//  sure how many values will be entered.  This means that you need to
//  quit reading when all the data is read and you need to know how many
//  values were read.  You also must avoid reading past the end of the
//  array.  Generally the C++ compiler will allow you to use illegal
//  array elements (index less than 0 or too big).  You will get a
//  "segmentation violation" if your request is way off.  Minor indexing
//  errors will just screw things up with no complaint from the 
//  computer.
//
    int i;
    for ( i = 0; i < N; i++ ) {
        cin >> data[i];
        if ( cin.fail() ) break;
    }
//
//  After this loop the number of array elements read will be i.
//  You could use cin.clear() after a failure to keep reading.
