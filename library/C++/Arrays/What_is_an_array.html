<h1> Arrays  </h1>
</center>

<p>
An array is a variable with a contiguous section of memory which can be
used by specifying an array name and index.  Arrays can be of any basic type
or user-defined types.
In the array declaration below we declare an array of 100 ints.
</p>

<pre>
     int data[100];
</pre>

<p>
To use an element of the array you use the array name followed by an integer
inside square brackets, like <code> data[0]</code>.
The first element of the array is at index 0 and the last is one less than the
size of the array.
We can use variables as array indexes so we can set all the elements of
<code>data</code> to 0 by:
</p>

<pre>
     for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++ ) data[i] = 0;
</pre>

<p>
The previous loop is a very common structure to use when processing arrays.
The first index is 0 since the array starts at 0.
The test is "less than" rather than "less than or equal" since you commonly
know the size of an array or how many array elements to process.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally it can be important to understand that the elements of an
array are located contiguously in memory.
For example, if <code>data[0]</code> is at location 1000000 and assuming that
<dode>int</code>s are 4 bytes each, <code>data[1]</code> is at address
1000004.
Array addressing is very simple for the computer to do which means that it
is very fast to use an array.
It takes to same amount of time to use index 1000000 of an array as index 0.
The address of an array element (using &amp; to mean address) for an
array x of type T is
</p>

<pre>
     &amp;x[i] == &amp;x + i * sizeof(T)
</pre>
