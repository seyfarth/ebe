<h1> Program Segments </h1>
</center>

<p>
A program generally has several different uses for memory.
The most obvious use is for code which is stored in an area of memory
referred to as the "text" segment identified as ".text".
In an assembly program you switch to the data segment using

<pre>
        segment .text
</pre>
You can also use the keyword "section" rather than segment.
</p>

<h2> Defined data </h2>

<p>
The segment for storing data with predefined values is the "data"
segment identified as ".data":
<pre>
        segment .data
</pre>
You can use this to store data like a counter or a printf format:
<pre>
        segment .data
i:      dd      1
format: db      "The count in %d", 0x0a, 0 ; C string with newline
</pre>
<p>

<h2> Reserved data </h2>

<p>
Part of the data for a program is for some memory with data initialized
to all zeroes.
This is called the "bss" segment which stands for "block started by
symbol".
Typically this data will be used for global data which will be
written by the program when it executes.
<pre>
        segment .bss
</pre>
You define variables in the bss segment using a collection of
pseudo-ops beginning with the prefix "res" meaning "reserve":
<pre>
        segment .bss
sum:    resw    1       ; reserve 1 word of memory
data:   resd    10      ; reserve 10 double words (4 bytes each)
name:   resb    17      ; reserve bytes for a C string
avg:    resq    1       ; reserve 1 quad-word (8 bytes)
</pre>
</p>

<h2> Stack </h2>

<p>
A program uses a run-time stack to implement function calls.
There is no explicit reference required to reference a stack segment
in assembly language.
The stack is used for function call frames which hold pointers to
previous call frames, parameters, local variables and the return address.
</p>

<h2> Heap </h2>

<p>
When a program allocates memory it uses a region of memory commonly
referred to as the heap.
Like the stack there is no reason to explicitly refer to the heap
segment.
Instead a program can call a function like malloc receiving an
address from the heap which it will generally need to save somewhere
in memory.
The pointer to the allocated memory could be stored in a global
variable is the data or bss segment, in a local variable in a
function's call frame or possibly in a data structure which itself
was dynamically allocated.
