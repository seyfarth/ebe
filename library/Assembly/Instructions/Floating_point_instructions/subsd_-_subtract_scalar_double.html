<h2> subsd - add scalar double (64 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest - source
</pre>
<p>
The subsd instruction subtracts the source value (second operand)
from the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 64 bit memory location.
There is also vsubsd on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding.

        subsd   xmm0, xmm1          ; subtract xmm1 from xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        subsd   xmm0, [x]           ; subtract 64 bit variable x from xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        subsd   xmm0, [rsi]         ; subtract 64 bit value [rsi] from xmm0
                                    ; rsi holds the address of a double
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        vsubsd  xmm3, xmm0, xmm15   ; xmm3 = xmm0 - xmm15

            ; Note: operates by copying 128 bits from xmm0 to xmm3
            ; before subtracting.  This might occasionally be useful.
            ; The rest of ymm0 is left as is
            ; using subsd would change either xmm0 or xmm15
            ; possibly requiring an additional instruction

        vsubsd  xmm3, xmm0, [x]     ; xmm3 = xmm0 - x
