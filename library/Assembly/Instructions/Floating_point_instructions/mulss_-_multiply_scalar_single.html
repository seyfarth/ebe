<h2> mulss - multiply scalar single (32 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest * source
</pre>
<p>
The mulss instruction multiplies the source value (second operand)
to the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 32 bit memory location.
There is also vmulss on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding.

        mulss   xmm0, xmm1          ; multiply xmm1 to xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        mulss   xmm0, [x]           ; multiply 32 bit variable x to xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        mulss   xmm0, [rdi]         ; multiply 32 bit value [rdi] to xmm0
                                    ; rdi holds the address of a float
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        mulss   xmm0, [x+4*rcx]     ; multiply 32 bit element of array x to xmm0
                                    ; rcx contains the array index
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        vmulss  xmm3, xmm0, xmm15   ; xmm3 = xmm0 * xmm15

            ; Note: operates by copying 128 bits from xmm0 to xmm3
            ; before multiplying.  This might occasionally be useful.
            ; The rest of ymm0 is left as is
            ; using mulss would change either xmm0 or xmm15
            ; possibly requiring an additional instruction

        vmulss  xmm3, xmm0, [x]     ; xmm3 = xmm0 * x
