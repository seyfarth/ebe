<h2> divps - divide packed singles (32 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest[0] = dest[0] / source[0]
dest[1] = dest[1] / source[1]
dest[2] = dest[2] / source[2]
dest[3] = dest[3] / source[3]
</pre>
<p>
The divps instruction divides the 4 source values (second operand)
into the 4 values of the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 32 bit memory location.
There is also vdivps on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding and which divides 8 pairs of values.
