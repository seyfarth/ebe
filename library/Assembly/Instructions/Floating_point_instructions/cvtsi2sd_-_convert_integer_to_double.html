<h2> cvtsi2sd - convert integer to double (64 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The cvtsi2sd instruction adds the source value (second operand)
to the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be a 32 or 64 bit general purpose register
or a 64 bit memory location.
</p>
<p>
If the integer can't be stored exactly as a double, it will be rounded
according to the MXCSR register.
For example the number 123456789123456789 fits in a quadword integer
but a double is only accurate for about 16 decimal digits.
It will probably be rounded up to about 1234567891234568xx though the final
8 may be a 7 and the last 2 digits will vary depending on the specific number.
