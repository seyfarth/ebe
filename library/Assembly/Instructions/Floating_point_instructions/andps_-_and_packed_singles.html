<h2> andps - and packed singles </h2>
<pre>
dest[0] = dest[0] | source[0]
dest[1] = dest[1] | source[1]
dest[2] = dest[2] | source[2]
dest[3] = dest[3] | source[3]
</pre>
<p>
The andps instruction ands the 4 source values (second operand)
to the 4 values of the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 32 bit memory location.
There is also vandps on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding and which ands 8 pairs of values
if you use YMM registers.

<p>
There is also andpd which ands packed doubles.  The result is the same so pick
your favorite.
