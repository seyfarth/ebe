<h2> subpd - 64 packed doubles (64 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest[0] = dest[0] - source[0]
dest[1] = dest[1] - source[1]
</pre>
<p>
The subpd instruction subtracts the 2 source values (second operand)
to the 2 values of the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 64 bit memory location.
There is also vsubpd on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding and which subtracts 4 pairs of values.
