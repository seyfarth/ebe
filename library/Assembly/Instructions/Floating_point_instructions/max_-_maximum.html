<h2> maxss, maxsd, maxps, maxpd - square root </h2>
<pre>
dest = max(source)
</pre>
<p>
The maxss, maxsd, maxps, and maxpd instructions computes
the maximum of the source and the destination and
store the result(s) in the destination operand.
There are also vmaxss, vmaxsd, vmaxps, and vmaxpd
on CPUs with AVX instructions which can compute multiple values at once.
Behaviorally these instructions are similar to the various add instructions
should you wish to see more details.

        maxss   xmm0, xmm1          ; xmm0 gets 32 bit max of xmm1
        maxsd   xmm0, [x]           ; xmm0 gets 64 bit max of x
        maxps   xmm0, [rdi]         ; xmm0 gets 4 32 bit maxs of [rdi]
        maxpd   xmm0, [x+4*rcx]     ; xmm0 gets 2 64 bit maxs of array x
        vmaxps  xmm3, xmm4, xmm15   ; xmm3 gets 4 32 bit maxs of xmm4 & xmm15
        vmaxps  ymm3, ymm4, ymm15   ; ymm3 gets 8 32 bit maxs of ymm4 & ymm15
        vmaxpd  ymm3, ymm5, [x]     ; ymm3 gets 4 64 bit maxs of ymm5 & array x
