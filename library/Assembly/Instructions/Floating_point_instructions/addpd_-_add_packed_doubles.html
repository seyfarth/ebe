<h2> addpd - add packed doubles (64 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest[0] = dest[0] + source[0]
dest[1] = dest[1] + source[1]
</pre>
<p>
The addpd instruction adds the 2 source values (second operand)
to the 2 values of the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 64 bit memory location.
There is also vaddpd on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding and which adds 4 pairs of values.
