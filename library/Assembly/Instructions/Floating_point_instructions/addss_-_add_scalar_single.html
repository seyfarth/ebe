<h2> addss - add scalar single (32 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest + source
</pre>
<p>
The addss instruction adds the source value (second operand)
to the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be an XMM register or a 32 bit memory location.
There is also vaddss on CPUs with AVX instructions which allows using
3 XMM registers or 2 XMM registers and a memory location
which can simplify coding.

        addss   xmm0, xmm1          ; add xmm1 to xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        addss   xmm0, [x]           ; add 32 bit variable x to xmm0
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        addss   xmm0, [x+4*rcx]     ; add 32 bit element of array x to xmm0
                                    ; rcx contains the array index
                                    ; leave the rest of xmm0 as is
        vaddss  xmm3, xmm0, xmm15   ; xmm3 = xmm0 + xmm15

            ; Note: operates by copying 128 bits from xmm0 to xmm3
            ; before adding.  This might occasionally be useful.
            ; The rest of ymm0 is left as is
            ; using addss would change either xmm0 or xmm15
            ; possibly requiring an additional instruction

        vaddss  xmm3, xmm0, [x]     ; xmm3 = xmm0 + x
