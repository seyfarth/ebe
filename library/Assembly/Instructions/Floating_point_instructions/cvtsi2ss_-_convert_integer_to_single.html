<h2> cvtsi2ss - convert integer to single (32 bit floating point) </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The cvtsi2ss instruction adds the source value (second operand)
to the destination (an XMM register).
The source can be a 32 or 64 bit general purpose register
or a 64 bit memory location.
</p>
<p>
If the integer can't be stored exactly as a float, it will be rounded
according to the MXCSR register.
For example the number 123456789 easily fits in a doubleword integer
but a float is only accurate for a little over 7 decimal digits.
It will probably be rounded to about 1234568xx, though the 8 may be a 7
and the last 2 digits may vary depending on the specific number.
