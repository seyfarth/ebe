<h2> movsx - move sign extend </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The movsx instruction moves the source value (second operand)
to the destination register and propagates the high order bit 
of the source through the rest of the destination.
The source can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.
The source must be a smaller size than the destination.
The purpose of the instruction is to move a signed integer into
a larger register and use it as a signed integer.
</p>
<p>
If the source is 32 bits, the instruction mnemonic is "movsxd" rather
than "movsx".
Technically it is a different bit pattern, but it would have been handier to
allow "movsx" to work for all cases.
Most programmers are unconcerned about the actual bits used for the
instruction.

        movsxd  rax, dword [x]  ; moves 32 bit variable x to eax
                                ; fills the rest of rax with x bit 31
        movsx   rax, byte [x]   ; moves 8 bit variable x to al
                                ; files the rest of rax with x bit 7
