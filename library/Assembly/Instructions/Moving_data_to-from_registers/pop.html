<h2> pop </h2>

dest = *rsp
rsp = rsp + 8       ; normal case

<p>
The pop instruction decrements the stack pointer (rsp) and then places
the operand at the memory address contained in rsp.
The destination can be a 64, 32, or 16 bit register or memory location.
While it is possible to pop quantities less than 64 bits, I suggest
exercising care when popping smaller quantities.
In general it is important to maintain the stack on 16 byte boundaries,
so if you wish to pop something and then call a function which you
did not write (like printf), then pop an even number of quadwords.
It is possible to write efficient code without pop.

<pre>
        pop    rbp              ; pop register rbp onto the stack
        pop    qword [x]        ; pop 64 bit variable x
        pop    eax              ; pop 32 bit register
