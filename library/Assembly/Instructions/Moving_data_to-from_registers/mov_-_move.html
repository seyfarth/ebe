<h2> mov - move </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The mov instruction moves the source value (second operand)
to the destination (either a register or a memory location).
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.  You can not use 2
memory addresses.
You also can't move an immediate value into a memory
address.
</p>
<p>
Moving a 32 bit quantity into a register will clear out the upper half
of the destination register.
Moving a 16 or 8 quantity into a register will leave the rest of the
register alone.

        mov     rax, 0xfedcba9876543210     ; move a 64 bit number into rax
        mov     eax, 12                     ; moves 12 into rax
                                            ; places 0 into upper half of rax
        mov     dx, ax                      ; moves ax into dx
                                            ; leaves upper 3/4 of rdx alone
        mov     rax, [y]                    ; moves 64 bit variable y into rax
        mov     [x], eax                    ; move eax into 32 bit variable x
