<h2> movss - move scalar single </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The movss instruction moves a single precision floating point value (32 bits)
from the source value (second operand)
to the destination.
The source and the destination can be an XMM register or a memory location.
You can not use 2 memory addresses.
</p>
<p>
movss moves the value without inspection or conversion.
</p>
<p>
Generally you can just act like movss moves a float from one place to
another, but when you move a float from memory to an XMM register 3
floats in the register are set to 0.  
An XMM register is 128 bits total, while CPUs supporting AVX instructions
have an additional 128 bits in each register accessible as YMM registers.

        movss   xmm1, xmm2      ; move a float from xmm2 to xmm1
                                ; leaves the rest of xmm1 unchanged
        movss   xmm2, [x]       ; moves a float from variable x to xmm2
                                ; places 3 zero floats in xmm2 bits 32:127
                                ; leaves the rest of xmm2 alone
        movss   [y], xmm0       ; moves a float from xmm0 to variable y
                                ; moves precisely 32 bits
