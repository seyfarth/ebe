<h2> xchg - exhange register with register or register with memory </h2>
<pre>
temp = source
source = dest
dest = temp
</pre>
<p>
The xchg instruction exchanges the source (second operand)
to the destination.
The destination and can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  
You can not use 2 memory addresses.
</p>
<p>
If either or both of the operands is a 32 bit register, the upper
half of the register(s) will be zeroed.
</p>
<pre>
        xchg    rax, r9         ; exchange rax and r9
        xchg    eax, edx        ; exchange eax and edx
                                ; places 0 into upper half of rax and rdx
        xchg    dx, ax          ; moves ax into dx
                                ; leaves upper 3/4 of rax and rdx alone
        xchg     rax, [y]       ; exchanges rax and 64 bit variable y
        xchg     [x], eax       ; exchange eax and 32 bit variable x
                                ; places 0 into upper half of rax
                                ; does not modify memory after x+3
