<h2> movd - move doubleword </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The movd instruction moves the source value (second operand)
to the destination.
The purpose of this instruction is to move a data between memory, general
purpose registers and floating point registers.
Thus the destination must be one of those categories and the source must be
a different category with one exception: movd can be used to move a value from
one floating point register to another.
The 32 bits are moved without conversion.

<pre>
        movd    eax, xmm0       ; move 32 bits of xmm0 to eax
                                ; places 0 in top half of rax
        movd    [x], xmm0       ; move 32 bits of xmm0 to 32 bit variable x
        movd    xmm0, [y]       ; move 32 bit variable y to xmm0
                                ; places 0 in upper 3/4 of xmm0
        movd    xmm2, xmm1      ; move 32 bits of xmm1 to xmm2
                                ; places 0 in upper 3/4 of xmm2
        movd    [x], eax        ; move eax to 32 bit variable x
