<h2> movzx - move zero extend </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The movzx instruction moves the source value (second operand)
to the destination register.
The source can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.
The source must be a smaller size than the destination.
If the destination is a 32 bit register, the top half is zeroed out as if
a 64 bit register were used.
</p>
<p>
movzx differs from mov in that it places 0's into all the higher order bits of
the destination register.

        movzx   rax, dx         ; moves dx to ax
                                ; zeroes out the rest of rax
        movzx   eax, dx         ; moves dx to ax
                                ; zeroes out the rest of rax
                                ; same as movzx rax, dx
        movzx   ax, dl          ; moves dl to al and 0 to ah
                                ; leaves the rest of rax alone
        movzx   eax, word [x]   ; moves 16 bit variable x to eax
                                ; zeroes out the rest of rax
        movzx   rax, dword [x]  ; moves 32 bit variable x to eax
                                ; zeroes out the rest of rax
                                ; same as mov eax, dword [x]
        movzx   rax, byte [x]   ; moves 8 bit variable x to al
                                ; zeroes out the rest of rax
