<h2> movq - move quadword </h2>
<pre>
dest = source
</pre>
<p>
The movq instruction moves the source value (second operand)
to the destination.
The purpose of this instruction is to move a data between memory, general
purpose registers and floating point registers.
Thus the destination must be one of those categories and the source must be
a different category with one exception: movq can be used to move a value from
one floating point register to another.
The 64 bits are moved without conversion.

<pre>
        movq    rax, xmm0       ; move xmm0 to rax
        movq    [x], xmm0       ; move xmm0 to 64 bit variable x
        movq    xmm0, [y]       ; move 64 bit variable y to xmm0
                                ; places 0 in second half of xmm0
        movq    xmm2, xmm1      ; move xmm1 to xmm2
                                ; places 0 in second half of xmm2
        movq    [x], rax        ; move rax to 64 bit variable x
