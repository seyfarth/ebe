<h2> lods - load string instructions </h2>
<pre>
mov the selected size to rax and increment/decrement rsi
</pre>
<p>
There are 4 varieties of lods: lodsb, lodsw, lodsd and lodsq which load
byte, word, doubleword and quadword values into al, ax, eax and rax.
After each load rsi is incremented (if DF=0) or decremented (if DF=1).
It is possible to use this with rep, but I can't imagine that I will ever wish
to repeatedly load values into rax.
Instead lods can be used within a loop to selectively load values and inspect
them.
In the example lodsb and stosb will be used to copy data until a 0 byte is
reached and carriage-return bytes (0x0d) will not be copied.

        lea     rdi, [dest]         ; get the address of the destination array
        lea     rsi, [source]       ; get the address of the source array
        cld                         ; clear the direction flag to increment
        mov     ecx, -1             ; count is pretty big
top:    lodsb                       ; get the next byte and increment rsi by 1
        cmp     al, 0x13
        je      top                 ; if the byte is \r skip it
        stos                        ; if it is not \r copy it
                                    ; this will increment rdi
        cmp     al, 0
        je      done                ; 0 byte means end of string
        loop    top                 ; rinse and repeat
