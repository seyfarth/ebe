<h2> scas - scan string instructions </h2>
<pre>
repeat *rdi++ = *rsi++
</pre>
<p>
There are 4 varieties of scas instructions: scasb, scasw, scasd and scasq
which are for byte, word, doubleword and quadword arrays.
They all operate using rcx to define the number of iterations to use with repe
or repne.
The scas instructions all use rdi as the address to start the scan,
The direction flag determines whether the address ir incremented (DF=0) or
decremented (DF=1).
Used with repe the scas instructions keep scanning as long as the array
elements match the proper part of rax.
Used with repne the scas instructions keep scanning until an array element
matches rax.
Thus scas can be used to look for a specific value like a 0 byte at the end of
a string or to find the first non-zero quadword in an array.

        lea     rdi, [data]         ; get the address of the array
        cld                         ; clear the direction flag to increment
        mov     ecx, 1000           ; count = 1000
        xor     eax, eax
        repe    scasq               ; move 1000 quadwords from source to dest
                                    ; rdi increments by 8 each time
        ; 1000 - ecx - 1 is the index of the first 0 in the array.
        ; If ecx == 0, check data[999] to see if it equals 0.
        ; If the first quadword is 0, then repe executes 1 time
        ; and ecx decrements to 999.  1000 - ecx - 1 = 0.
        ; Suppose the second quadword is the first 0.
        ; Then ecx decrements twice and 1000 - ecx - 1 = 1.

        lea     rdi, [data+7992]    ; get the address of the array
                                    ; 7992 = 999 * 8, the offset of element 999
        std                         ; set the direction flag to decrement
        mov     ecx, 1000           ; count = 1000
        mov     eax, 100
        repe    scasq               ; move 1000 quadwords from source to dest
                                    ; rdi increments by 8 each time
        cld                         ; to leave it cleared
        ; This searched backwards looking for 100.
        ; If element data[999] == 100, ecx decrements once and ecx = 999.
        ; So ecx is the index of the rightmost 100 in the data array.
        ; You need to check data[0] if ecx == 0.

        lea     rdi, [data]         ; get the address of the array
        cld                         ; clear the direction flag to increment
        mov     ecx, -1             ; count is pretty big
                                    ; Your program might die if it can't
                                    ; find a 0.
        xor     al, al              ; will scan for 0 byte
        repne   scasb               ; scan forward at most a lot
                                    ; rdi increments by 1 each time
                                    ; repeats while the byte scanned is != al
        mov     eax, -2             ; we start at -1 end up 1 past the end
        sub     eax, ecx            ; yields the length of a C string
        ; Consider a string of length 0.
        ; The first iteration of the repeat finds the 0 byte.
        ; This means ecx == -2 and subtracting -2 - -2 = 0

        ; Consider a string of length 1.
        ; The second iteration of the repeat finds the 0 byte.
        ; This means ecx == -3 and -2 - -3 = 1.
