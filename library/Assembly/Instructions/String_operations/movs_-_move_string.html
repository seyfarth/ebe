<h2> movs - move string instructions </h2>
<pre>
repeat *rdi++ = *rsi++
</pre>
<p>
There are 4 varieties of movs instructions: movsb, movsw, movsd and movsq
which are for byte, word, doubleword and quadword arrays.
They all operate using rcx to define the number of iterations to use with rep
and there is no testing of the data as it is copied.
The source array address is stored in rsi and the destination in rdi.
The direction flag determines whether the addresses are incremented (DF=0) or
decremented (DF=1).
It is more efficient to copy memory using increasing addresses, though you may
need to copy from a higher address to a lower address in the same array which
can be done with decreasing addresses.

Note that movsd is "move scalar double" if not preceded by rep.

        lea     rdi, [dest]         ; get the address of the destination array
        lea     rsi, [source]       ; get the address of the source array
        cld                         ; clear the direction flag to increment
        mov     ecx, 1000           ; count = 1000
        rep     movsq               ; move 1000 quadwords from source to dest
                                    ; rdi and rsi increment by 8 each time

        lea     rsi, [source]       ; get the address of the source array
        cld                         ; clear the direction flag to increment
        mov     ecx, -1             ; count is pretty big
        xor     al, al              ; will scan for 0 byte
        repne   movsb               ; move 1000 bytes from source to dest
                                    ; rsi increments by 1 each time
