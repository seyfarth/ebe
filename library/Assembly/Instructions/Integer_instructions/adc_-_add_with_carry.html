<h2> adc - add with carry </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest + source + CF
</pre>
<p>
The adc instruction adds the source value (second operand)
to the destination (either a register or a memory location) plus
the carry flag..
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.  You can not use 2
memory addresses.  You can add either 8, 16 or 32 bit immediate values
to larger registers and the immediate value will be sign extended.
</p>
<p>
adc is designed to simplify adding large integers.
In the code below a 256 bit sum is produced.

<pre>
        mov     rax, [b]    ; get the low quadword of b, b[0]
        add     [a], rax    ; add b[0] to a[0]
        mov     rax, [b+8]  ; get the next quadword, b[1]
        adc     [a+8], rax  ; add the 2 quadwords + CF
        mov     rax, [b+16] ; get the next quadword, b[2]
        adc     [a+16], rax ; add the 2 quadwords + CF
        mov     rax, [b+24] ; get the next quadword, b[3]
        adc     [a+24], rax ; add the 2 quadwords + CF
