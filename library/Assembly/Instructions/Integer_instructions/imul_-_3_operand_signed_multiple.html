<h2> imul - 3 operand signed multiply </h2>
<pre>
dest = source1 * source2
</pre>
<p>
The 3 operand imul instruction has a destination register as its first operand
which will receive the product of the 2 source operands.
The first source operand can be a register or a memory location and the second
operand is required to be an immediate value.
The product may be truncated.

<pre>
        imul    r10, r12, 13    ; multiply r12 by 13 and store in r10
        imul    r8d, r10d, 12   ; multiply r10d by 12 and store in r8d
                                ; top half of r8 will be 0
        imul    rdx, [x], 125   ; multiply 64 bit variable x by 125
                                ; and store in rdx
        shl     rax, 4          ; shift right 4 (quick multiply by 16)
