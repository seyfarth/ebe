<h2> sub - subtract </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest - source
</pre>
<p>
The sub instruction subtracts the source value (second operand)
from the destination (either a register or a memory location).
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.  You can not use 2
memory addresses.  You can subtract either 8, 16 or 32 bit immediate values
to larger registers and the immediate value will be sign extended.

        sub     rax, 5          ; subtract 5 from rax
        sub     eax, r9d        ; subtract r9d from eax
                                ; the top half of rax is set to 0
        sub     ax, dx          ; subtract dx from ax
                                ; to top 3/4 of rax is left as is
        sub     [x], rcx        ; subtract rcx from 64 variable x
        sub     [x], eax        ; subtract eax from 32 variable x
        sub     dword [x], 10   ; subtract 10 from 32 bit variable x
                                ; must specify qword, dword, word or byte
