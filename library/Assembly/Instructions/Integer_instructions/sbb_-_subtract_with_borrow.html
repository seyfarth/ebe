<h2> sbb - subtract with borrow </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest - (source + CF)
</pre>
<p>
The sbb instruction subtracts the source value (second operand) plus the
carry frag
from the destination (either a register or a memory location).
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.  You can not use 2
memory addresses.  You can subtract either 8, 16 or 32 bit immediate values
to larger registers and the immediate value will be sign extended.
</p>
<p>
sbb is designed to simplify subtracting large integers.
In the code below a 256 bit difference is produced.

<pre>
        mov     rax, [b]    ; get the low quadword of b, b[0]
        sub     [a], rax    ; subtract b[0] from a[0]
        mov     rax, [b+8]  ; get the next quadword, b[1]
        sbb     [a+8], rax  ; subtract the 2 quadwords + CF
        mov     rax, [b+16] ; get the next quadword, b[2]
        sbb     [a+16], rax ; subtract the 2 quadwords + CF
        mov     rax, [b+24] ; get the next quadword, b[3]
        sbb     [a+24], rax ; subtract the 2 quadwords + CF
