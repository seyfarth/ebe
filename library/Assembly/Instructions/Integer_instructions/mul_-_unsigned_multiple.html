<h2> mul - unsigned multiply </h2>
<pre>
rdx:rax = rax * source
edx:eax = eax * source
dx:ax = ax * source
al = al = rax * source
</pre>
<p>
The mul instruction for 64, 32 and 16 bit source operand
sizes uses a pair of registers for the product.
For 8 bit operands the product is stored in ax.
For 64, 32 and 16 bit the single operand is one multiplier and the other is
rdx, eax or ax.
For 8 bit operands the second multiplier is al and the product is stored in
ax.
The single operand is one multiplier and can be either a register or a memory
address.

<pre>
        mul     r9              ; multiply rax by r9
        mul     dword 10        ; multiply eax by 10
        mul     dword [x]       ; multiply eax by 32 bit variable x
        shl     rax, 4          ; shift right 4 (quick multiply by 16)

<h3>
flags: OF CF
</h3>
<p>
OF and CF are set to 0 if the upper half of the product is 0 and 1 otherwise.
