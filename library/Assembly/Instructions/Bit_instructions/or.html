<h2> or </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest | source
</pre>
<p>
The or instruction ors the source value (second operand)
to the destination (either a register or a memory location).
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.
You can not use 2 memory addresses.
</p>
<p>
The operation performs a bitwise or of the 2 operands.
In my description or is a bit setter - the 1 bits from the second
operand are used to set the same bits in the first operand.
Here is an example of a bitwise or.

Some examples of using and:

<pre>
        or      rax, 0x1000     ; or rax with 0x1000
                                ; sets bit 12 of rax
        or      eax, 0xff00     ; or eax with 0xff00
                                ; fills upper half of rax with 0
        or      dx, ax          ; or dx and ax, result in dx
                                ; leaves the rest of rdx alone
        or      rax, [y]        ; or rax with 64 bit variable y
        or      [x], eax        ; or 32 bit varaible x with eax
