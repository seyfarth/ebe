<h2> ror - rotate right </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest @>> source      ; made up notation for rotate
</pre>
<p>
The ror instruction rotates the destination right the number of times
indicated by the source.
Rotating right by is like shifting right, but the bits shifted out
the right end are entered onto the left end.
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.
The source can be either an immediate value or the cl register.
</p>
<p>
There is also a rcr instruction which adds the carry flag as an additional
bit in the rotation.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of a rotate right:
</p>
<pre>
     1010010010101011
               @>>  3
     ----------------
     0010010101011101

<p>
Some examples of using ror:
</p>
<pre>
        ror     rax, 15         ; rotate rax 15 bits
        ror     eax, 10         ; rotate eax 10 bits
                                ; fills upper half of rax with 0
        ror     dx, cl          ; rotate dx the cl bits right
                                ; leaves the rest of rdx alone
        ror     [x], 2          ; rotate 32 bit variable x 2 bits
</pre>
<h3>
flags: OF CF
</h3>
<p>
CF contains the last bit shifted out. OF is changed only for single bit
shifts.
