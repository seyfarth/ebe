<h2> bt - bit test </h2>
<pre>
CF = bit(dest, source)  ; extract bit numbered by source from dest
</pre>
<p>
The bt instruction uses the source value as the bit number of the
destination to test.
The destination can be a 64, 32 or 16 bit register or
memory location.
The source can be either an immediate value or a register of the same
size as the destination.
</p>
<p>
When testing based on a memory address using a register, the register can
hold a larger integer which defines a doubleword in memory to test
and a bit within the doubleword.
So you can access an array of bits.
</p>
<p>
Some examples of using bt:
</p>
<pre>
        bt     rax, 15         ; test bit 15 of rax
        bt     eax, 10         ; test bit 10 of eax
        bt     dx, cx          ; cx contains bit number of dx to test
        bt     [x], rdx        ; rdx contains bit number of x to test
</pre>
