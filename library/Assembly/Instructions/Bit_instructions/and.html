<h2> and </h2>
<pre>
dest = dest &amp; source
</pre>
<p>
The and instruction ands the source value (second operand)
to the destination (either a register or a memory location).
The destination can be a 64, 32, 16 or 8 bit register or
memory location.  The source can be either
a register, memory location or an immediate value.
You can not use 2 memory addresses.
</p>
<p>
The operation performs a bitwise and of the 2 operands.
In my description and is a bit selector - the second operand is a mask
selecting certain bits of the first operand.
Here is an example of a bitwise and.

Some examples of using and:
</p>
<pre>
        and     rax, 0xffff     ; and rax with 0xffff
                                ; selects the lowest 16 bits of rax
        and     eax, 0xff00     ; and eax with 0xff00
                                ; fills upper half of rax with 0
        and     dx, ax          ; ands dx and ax, result in dx
                                ; leaves the rest of rdx alone
        and     rax, [y]        ; ands rax with 64 bit variable y
        and     [x], eax        ; ands 32 bit varaible x with eax
