<h2> bts - bit test and set </h2>
<pre>
CF = bit(dest, source)  ; extract & set bit numbered by source from dest
bit(dest,source) = 1
</pre>
<p>
The btc instruction uses the source value as the bit number of the
destination to test and set.
The destination can be a 64, 32 or 16 bit register or
memory location.
The source can be either an immediate value or a register of the same
size as the destination.
</p>
<p>
When testing and setting 
based on a memory address using a register as source operand, the register can
hold a larger integer which defines a doubleword in memory to test
and a bit within the doubleword.
So you can access an array of bits.
</p>
<p>
Probably the most likely use of bts is simply to set a particular bit.
It just happens that testing can be done in the same instruction and
you can ignore the CF.

Some examples of using bts:
</p>
<pre>
        bts     rax, 15         ; test and set bit 15 of rax
        bts     eax, 10         ; test and set bit 10 of eax
        bts     dx, cx          ; cx contains bit number of dx to test & set
        bts     [x], rdx        ; rdx contains bit number of x to test & set
</pre>
