<h2> btr - bit test and reset </h2>
<pre>
CF = bit(dest, source)  ; extract & reset bit numbered by source from dest
bit(dest,source) = 0
</pre>
<p>
The btr instruction uses the source value as the bit number of the
destination to test and reset.
The destination can be a 64, 32 or 16 bit register or
memory location.
The source can be either an immediate value or a register of the same
size as the destination.
</p>
<p>
When testing and resetting 
based on a memory address using a register as source operand, the register can
hold a larger integer which defines a doubleword in memory to test
and a bit within the doubleword.
So you can access an array of bits.
</p>
<p>
Probably the most likely use of btr is simply to reset a particular bit.
It just happens that testing can be done in the same instruction and
you can ignore the CF.

<p>
Some examples of using btr:
</p>
<pre>
        btr     rax, 15         ; test and reset bit 15 of rax
        btr     eax, 10         ; test and reset bit 10 of eax
        btr     dx, cx          ; cx contains bit number of dx to test & reset
        btr     [x], rdx        ; rdx contains bit number of x to test & reset
</pre>
