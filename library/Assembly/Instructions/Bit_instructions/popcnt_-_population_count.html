<h2> popcnt - population count </h2>
<pre>
dest = number of 1 bits in the source
</pre>
<p>
popcnt is a fairly new instruction introduced as part of the SSE4 instructions.
For AMD it started showing up in the Barcelona processors, while it originated
with the Intel Core 2 series.
</p>
<p>
The popcnt instruction counts the 1 bits in the source
and sets the destination to this count.
The destination can be a 64, 32 or 16 bit register.
The source can be register or memory location of the same
size as the destination.

<p>
Some examples of using popnt:
</p>
<pre>
        popcnt rax, rcx       ; rax gets the count of 1s in rcx
        popcnt eax, r8d       ; eax gets the count of 1s in r8b
                              ; top half of rax will be 0
        popcnt dx, cx         ; dx gets the count of 1s in cx
                              ; the rest of rx is left alone
        popcnt [x], rdx       ; rdx contains bit number of x to test
</pre>
