<h2> jmp - jump </h2>
<pre>
rip = dest
</pre>
<p>
The jmp instruction transfers control (modifies rip) to the
location specified by its single operand.
The destination can be a 64 bit register, a memory location or
an immediate value.
In your code you typically jump to a label.
The assembler then translates this label into an immediate value
which is an offset relative to rip.
Sometimes this is an 8 bit offset and other times 32 bits.
</p>
<p>
Only the first form below is likely to be needed.
The others are possible, but not exactly needed.
The last example can be used to prepare a "jump table" which is an array
of addresses which can be used to make a very fast switch statement.

<pre>
        jmp     top             ; jump to the label top
                                ; yasm picks 8 or 32 bit offset from rip
        jmp     rax             ; jump to the location in rax
                                ; rax will have an address, not an offset
        jmp     [save]          ; save is a 64 bit variable
                                ; save contains an address in it
                                ; jump to the contents stored in save
        jmp     [switch+8*rax]  ; array named switch contains some addresses
                                ; rax is an index into the array
