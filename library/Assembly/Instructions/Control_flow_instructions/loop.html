<h2> loop </h2>
<pre>
rip = dest if rcx is not 0
</pre>
<p>
The loop instruction decrements rcx and transfers control (modifies rip) to the
location specified by its single operand if rcx is not 0 after the decrement.
The only choice is for the destination to be an 8 bit rip-relative offset.
For this reason it can only be used for moderate sized loops.

        mov     ecx, 100            ; set rcx to 100
loop_top:
        ...
        loop loop_top               ; loop executes 100 times
