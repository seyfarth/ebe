<h2> loopCC - loop if CC </h2>
<pre>
rip = dest if rcx is not 0 or CC is true
</pre>
<p>
There are 2 versions of loopCC: loope and loopne.
Both instructions decrement rcx and the loop will end if rcs == 0;
In addition an operation within the loop can affect the zero flag
and if ZF matches the condition control will transfer to the destination.
The only choice is for the destination to be an 8 bit rip-relative offset.
For this reason it can only be used for moderate sized loops.
</p>
        mov     ecx, 100            ; set rcx to 100
loop_top:
        ...
        cmp     rax, rdx
        loope   loop_top            ; loop executes 100 times
                                    ; or until rax is not equal to rdx
</pre>
<p>
And now an example with loopne
</p>
<pre>
        mov     ecx, 100            ; set rcx to 100
loop_top:
        ...
        cmp     al, 0x0a           ; compare against new-line
        loopne  loop_top           ; loop executes 100 times
                                   ; or until al equals '\n'
</pre>
