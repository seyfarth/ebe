<h2> setCC - set byte on condition </h2>
<pre>
dest = selected condition
</pre>
<p>
The setCC instruction sets an 8 bit register or memory location
with the value of the specified condition.
The byte will be 1 if the condition is true and 0 if it is false.

        setae   ; set above or equal    ; CF=0

        setpo   ; set parity odd        ; PF=1
        sets    ; set sign              ; SF=1
        setz    ; set zero              ; ZF=1

<p>
These instructions let you save the state of a comparison for later use.
Perhaps a test requires 2 or more conditions which involve several instructions
each and it is easier to save several conditions and later use and to see
all of them are true.
You can also use negated conditions by inserting "n" between the "set" and the
condition code.
</p>
<p>
In the examples below the comments mention setting the destination to 1 if
the condition is true.
If the condition is false the destination will be set to 0, but there is
no comment about the 0.

        setz    al          ; set al to 1 if the result was 0
        setge   byte [x]    ; set 8 bit variable x to 1 if greater or equal
        setnc   r8b         ; set r8b to 1 if there was no carry
                            ; this also can be used after a bit test or shift
        setae   byte [x]    ; set 8 bit variable x to 1 if above or equal
                            ; above and below are used after performing
                            ; floating point tests with perhaps ucomisd
