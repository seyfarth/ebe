#       Using equates to work with a customer class
#       Probably not worth it trying to really cope with classes

c_id    .equ    0          # offset for id (4 byte int)
c_name  .equ    c_id+4     # offset for name (16 byte array)
c_date  .equ    c_name+16  # offset for a data (8 byte array)
c_size  .equ    c_data+8   # size of the struct

#       You need to make sure that c_size == sizeof(customer) in C++.
#       Also you need to make sure that all the alignments match.

        mov     %ecx, c_id(%eax)      # place id in class object

#       use memcpy for the rest
