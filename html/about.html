<p>
Ebe is an integrated development environment developed primarily for teaching
assembly language.
It also allows development in C, C++ and Fortran.
The primary goal is to make development as simple as possible for beginners.
To that end a program can consist of a single source code file and the Run
button builds the program and runs it using gdb internally as a debugger.
</p>

<p>
One advantage of ebe for assembly language is the ability to define local
variables simply while editing.
The user can click on a variable name or an address in a register and define
a variable using a popup menu.
The variable is then displayed each time gdb returns control back to ebe.
</p>

<p>
To permit programming C/assembly mixed programming, ebe allows a very simple
form of projects which is not required for simpler programs.
</p>

<p>
The first version of ebe was written in Python, using tkinter and pmw for
GUI support.
This version is written in C++ using QT, primarily for more sophisticated
controls.
