<h1> Breakpoints </h1>

<h2> What is a breakpoint? </h2>

<p>
A breakpoint is a point in your source code which will cause the 
debugger to stop executing your program when it runs your program. 
If you set a breakpoint on line 10 of your code, the debugger will 
execute all lines up to line 10 when you click the Run button.  Line 
10 will not be run until you take another action like using one of 
the Next, Step or Continue buttons.
</p>

<p>
A breakpoint is visually identified in the source code window by using 
a different color for the first character of the line with a breakpoint. 
Ebe uses a bright red background with yellow letters for easy 
identification of lines with breakpoints.
</p>

<h2> Setting and clearing a breakpoint </h2>

<p>
You set or clear a breakpoint using a right click in the source window. 
Place the cursor somewhere on the desired line and right click.  The 
first click with set the breakpoint and the second will clear it.  You 
may also click with either the left or right mouse button in the line 
numbers column to the left of the source code to toggle a breakpoint 
on a line.
