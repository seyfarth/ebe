<h1> Editing in ebe </h1>


<p>
Editing in ebe uses the mouse and keyboard in mostly normal ways for
editors.  Special keys like Delete and Enter work as expected.  For
many of these normal keys an additional action is invoked using the
Control key and the normal key.
</p>

<h2> Navigation </h2>

<p>
<b> Scrollbars:</b> There are vertical and horizontal scrollbars which can
scroll through the file.  Scrolling can also be done using the mouse
wheel.
</p>

<p>
<b> Arrow keys:</b> Moving 1 character at a time is done using the arrow keys
on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control + Arrow keys:</b> Control-Right moves 1 word to the right.
Control-Left moves 1 word to the left.  Control-Up moves 1 paragraph
up.  Control-Down moves 1 paragraph down.
</p>

<p>
<b>Home/End:</b> Home moves to column 1 on the current line.  End moves
to the end of the current line.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control + Home/End:</b> Control-Home moves to column 1 of line 1.
Control-End moves to the end of the file.
</p>

<p>
<b>PageUp/PageDown:</b> These keys move up/down one screenful at a
time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control-T/Control-B:</b> Control-T moves to column 1 of the top line
currently on the screen.  Control-B moves to column 1 of the last
line currently on the screen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control-M:</b> Control-M scrolls the screen until the current line is at the
middle of the screen.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control-L:</b> Control-L will pop up a dialog where you can enter a line
number to go to.  The dialog is designed so that you can simple press
Control-L, type in the line number and press Enter without having to
use the mouse.
</p>

<h2> Editing </h2>

<p>
<b>Left mouse:</b> Dragging with the left mouse button help down can be
used to mark a section of text.  Double clicking with the left mouse
button will select a "word" of text.
</p>

<p>
<b>Select all:</b> You can select all of the text using Control-A or the Edit
menu option.
</p>

<p>
<b>Select none:</b> The best way to select none is to click with the mouse in
the edit window which cancels the selection.  You can also cancel any select
using Control-0 or the Edit menu option, but this option moves you back
to line 1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cut/Copy/Paste:</b> Selected text can be cut, copied and pasted using
either options in the Edit menu or Control-X for cut, Control-C for
copy, or Control-V for paste.
</p>

<p>
<b>Undo/Redo:</b> Control-Z will undo an edit operation.  Insertions will be
undone line at a time.  Control-Y will redo an edit operation.  The editor
maintains a stack of edit operations which is probably plenty.
</p>

<p>
<b>Find/Replace:</b> Use Control-F to pop up the Find/Replace dialog.
There is a text entry box there for entering a string to find.  The
focus is ready for you to type the search string when the dialog starts.
If you simply want to find, then enter either Enter or Control-F as
many times as you wish.  If you wish to change the string, then use
Tab to move to the text entry box for the replacement field and enter
a string.  To replace the string, use Control-R.  You can end the
Find/Replace dialog using Control-D.
</p>

<p>
<b>Backspace/Delete:</b> Backspace will delete the character to the left of
the cursor while Delete will delete the character to the right of the
cursor.  Control-Backspace will delete the "word" to the left of the
cursor and Control-Delete will delete the "word" to the right of the
cursor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Tab:</b> Entering a tab character will enter enough spaces to move to the
next tab stop.  By default tabs are at columns 5, 9, 13, ... - indenting 4
characters for each tab.  Control-Tab will delete characters to the
left of the cursor to position to the previous tab column.  The tab width can
be changed by changing the "tab_width" parameter is the file ".ebe.ini".
</p>

<p>
<b>Auto-indent:</b> The editor will automatically enter spaces so that a new
line will be indented just the same as the previous line.  Ebe will
indent the next line after a line ending in "{".  Likewise it will
de-indent when a line begins with "}".  Adjusting
indentation for a new line can be done using Tab or Control-Tab.
Auto-indent can be turned off by setting "auto_indent" to false in ".ebe.ini".
</p>

<p>
<b>Commenting:</b> Control-K will comment out the current line or a range of
lines if some text is selected.  Control-U will uncomment either the
current line or a range of lines.
</p>

<p>
<b>Word/number completion:</b> Ebe keeps track of words and numbers longer than
three characters to simplify entering/re-entering longer words.  It starts
with the a collection of keywords and adds words and numbers as you edit. 
When you enter some text ebe will present a list of possible completions to
select from.  Press enter after moving up or down in the list to enter the
selection completion.  You can also type more text or press Escape to cancel
the completion. You can change the minimum by changing the "minimum" value of
the "complete" section of ".ebe.ini".
