<h1> Projects </h1>

<p>
A program in ebe is generally managed using a project file to keep
track of the source code files in the program.  The name of a project
is the name of the program with ".ebe" appended to the name.  Thus to
build a program named "hello", you would use a project file named "hello.ebe".
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to use a project file with programs consisting of a
single source code file.  Ebe starts execution with no known project
name (if not given on the command line).  As long as there is no known
project name, it is assumed that there is only 1 source file.  Creating
a project or opening a project will change the state so that ebe will be
aware of having a project file.  After that point ebe will keep track of
the files using the project file.
</p>

<h2>
Creating a new project
</h2>

<p>
You can create a new project using the "New project" option under the
File menu.  This option will allow you to navigate to a new directory
and to specify the name of the new project file.  After creating the
project file, any open source files will be closed and the project will
be empty.  Any changes to the project will be written automatically so
there is no need to save a project file.
</p>

<h2>
Opening a project
</h2>

<p>
You can open an existing project using the "Open project" option under
the File menu.  This option will allow you to navigate to a new directory
open a file with the ".ebe" extension.  After opening the project file,
any open source files will be closed and the first file in the project
will be opened in the editor.
</p>

<h2>
Closing a project
</h2>

<p>
If you close the active project ebe will return to the default mode of
not using a project.  It will close all open files.
