<h1> Starting with ebe </h1>

<h2> Tooltips </h2>

<p>
Move the mouse over the various windows and items in windows and 
wait about a half second to see tooltips.  You can generally 
make a tooltip disappear by using either the mouse wheel or clicking. 
For the source window the you need to left click in the text 
to hide the tooltip. 
Tooltips will help as you get used to the program. 
You can turn off the tooltips in the menu.
</p>

<h2> Menu </h2>

<p>
The menu system contains nearly everything which can be done in the 
program. Nearly all the menu options have keyboard shortcuts.  Use 
the menu to figure out what all can be done and learn some keyboard 
tricks as you progress.  A few things like using control with the arrow 
keys are not in the menu, so experiment.
</p>

<h2> Debugging </h2>

<p>
Each time you click on the Run button the program saves your source 
code, runs the compiler and then starts running your program in the 
debugger.  Most likely you will want to get a breakpoint before clicking 
Run.  Do this by clicking to the left of a source code line where you 
would like to have the program stop and inspect things.  Then you can 
click Run and Next/Step to step through your program 1 line at a time. 
Use Next to stay within the same function or subroutine.  Use Step if 
you wish to debug inside a function or subroutine.
