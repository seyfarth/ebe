Here are the Windows installers for the ebe IDE.  There are 2 installers: one for 32 bit Windows and one for 64 bit Windows.  Each installer installs the gcc compiler collection from http://www.equation.com.  Ebe itself is a 32 bit application which has been compiled with the Microsoft command line C++ compiler.

Generally it would be a better choice to select the version with the largest version number.  There are usually new features and problems fixed with newer versions.  For example version 2.0.10 includes the first version of the toybox and it is probably more reliable than  2.0.09.  Version 2.0.09 has better support for 32 bit compilations than 2.0.08.

ebe32-2.0.??-setup.exe:  includes 32 bit compilers:  gcc, g++, gfortran

ebe64-2.0.??-setup.exe:  includes 64 bit compilers:  gcc, g++, gfortran

ebe-2.0.??-update.exe: includes just the latest ebe.  This will update
installs from 2.0.08 forward.

Both installers should run fine under 64 bit Windows.  Only the 32 bit installer will work properly under 32 bit Windows.  It would install and ebe would start, but the compilers would not run.

This code has been tested under Windows 7 and 8.  It is unknown whether there are issues with other versions of Windows.

There are still many changes planned for qtebe.  In particular the library in the program (bottom icon on the C++ code toolbar) will be growing.  Check back frequently for updates.  The gcc portions are not changing, so using the ebe-2.0.??-update.exe should be a quicker way to udate your software.

Problems
========

The ebe configuration file ".ebe.ini" can be a source of problems.  For example early versions of the config file did not have quotes around file names while later ones do.  This can mean a failure with files/directories with spaces in the name.  So it should be an early step in coping with a problem to remove ".ebe.ini" from the directory you were using.

Repeated installs are leaving the program's directory in the Path variable multiple times.  The update exes are modified to no change the Path.

2.0.16  Added libary of code snippets; icon on template toolbar
        Revised program to find ebe.rcc with .exe file

2.0.15  Added a missing DLL: msvcr100.dll

2.0.14  Changed the installer to avoid needing to logout and back in

2.0.13  Added more options for formatting floating point data
           in the data window.

           Handles basic types and arrays
        Fixed handling or char ** and char * types
        Fixed identification of globals under Windows
        Fixed output of stderr to be unbuffered

2.0.11  Added more floating point formats to the toybox
        Fixed link commands for Fortran and C
        Added closeEvent function to mainwindow
        Fortran debugging is not really useful yet

            with C++ numeric expressions

2.0.09  Fixed problem with spaces in pathnames
        Implemented EOF handling using Control-D (C OR Z)
        Handling of data types for 32 bit programs improved
        Users will probably need to remove old .ebe.ini files


2.0.06  Solved problem with loading template main programs
        Repaired gdb.cpp data item types/sizes issues
        Fetched settings from .ebe.ini on directory change
        Made settings changes take effect upon save
        Allowed _ to start identifiers

2.0.05  Gave up on reading template code from resource files and used
            string constants.
        Removed a pointless char array from gdb.cpp.

2.0.04  Repaired problem with determining next line/file from gdb
        Fixed issue with added lines looking like breakpoints after
            setting 1 breakpoint.
        Bug: When lines are deleted breakpoints are not handled properly.
