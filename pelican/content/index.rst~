This spring I will conduct
Assembly Language tutorials using a Google+ Hangout. 
My plan is to have 1 hour tutorials on Mondays at 1:00 PM Central Time
until mid May.
If you wish to participate my Google account is "ray.seyfarth".
With a Google account you can start by adding me to one of your circles.
It could be interesting and it should be useful.

The era of 64 bit computing is now. You know your computer
will run faster with more RAM than 4 GB and a 32 bit computer is
limited to 4 GB. With a 64 bit CPU and a 64 bit operating
system you can have more RAM - more RAM for programs and more RAM
for buffer cache. Your computer will run faster.

In addition to allowing your computer to use more RAM, running
your PC in 64 bit mode will enable the use of more
registers. A PC running in 32 bit mode has 8 registers -
with 2 of them tied up in the stack pointer and frame
pointer. In 64 bit mode the CPU has 8 additional general
purpose registers and 8 additional floating point
registers. These additional registers allow compilers to
perform better optimization and all function parameters to be
placed in registers rather than being pushed on the stack.
These new registers also help your computer run faster.

"Introduction to 64 Bit Assembly Language Programming for
Linux and OS X" teaches only 64 bit programming.
This simplifies the subject making it easier to learn.

This is the third edition of the assembly book. The primary
changes to the book are the inclusion of OS X support for
assmebly programming and the discussion of the Qt version of ebe.
Examples in the book are frequently illustrated using windows from ebe. 
Ebe is an acronym for "Easy Beginner Environment" and targets
teaching assembly language. It is easy to use and makes
learning assembly language easier.

.. _`Introduction to 64 Bit Windows Assembly Programming`: windows.html

Learn 64 bit assembly language using the Windows operating system.
This is an adaptation of the Linux assembly book which covers the same
basic topics.
It is designed for people familiar with one higher level programming language.
Ideally this language would be C or C++ since the book explains how to
call assembly functions from C and vice versa.

The discussion is based on using the free IDE, ebe, which internally uses
the GNU C and C++ compilers along with the yasm assembly to build programs.
The differences between the Windows and Linux/OS X books are primarily
the function call protocol.
Windows uses 4 registers for parameters which Linux and OS X use more.
The sequence of registers is different and there are a few other function
call differences.
In the interest of keeping the book accessible to programmers with about 1
year of experience, the choice was made to offer a separate book.

Ebe is an integrated development environment designed to make it
easier to write and debug assembly language programs. To the
right is an example of the source window in ebe with a short assembly
program. The red background on the line number for line 13
indicates that there is a breakpoint on line 13. The light blue
background on line 15 indicates that line 15 is the next instruction
to execute while debugging.

Ebe supports programming in Assembly, C, C++ and Fortran. When
you click green alien icon ebe runs the appropriate compiler or
assembler and then starts running your program using the gdb
debugger. You use the icons to the right of the alien to do the
next instruction, step into a function, continue or stop
debugging. You can view the registers in a register window and
program variables in a data window. Ebe makes is easy for you to
define variables based on labels in the code or addresses contained in
registers.

The latest ebe includes growing support for different languages
including Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish
and Swedish. The Arabic, French, Hindi, Spanish and Swedish
translations have been reviewed by people who speak those
languages. The rest are from Google Translate and may be
poor. Help is needed from around the world to improve the
accessibility of ebe.
