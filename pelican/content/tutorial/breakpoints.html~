    <h2>Breakpoints</h2>
    <p>
        When debugging a program it is convenient to be able to control the
        flow of a program, stopping it to observe variables, and restarting
        it. A breakpoint is a line which will cause the program to stop
        when it is reached. This line will not be executed when the
        program stops. When the program stops control is passed back to
        the debugger process. The debugger used by ebe is
        gdb. Normally when gdb stops it allows the user to type in
        commands. When it stops at a breakpoint in ebe, control is given
        back to ebe and ebe sends the commands to gdb.

    <h2>Setting or clearing a breakpoint</h2>
    <p>
        To the left of the source code in the ebe source window
        is a column of line numbers.
        You can see that lines 8 and 12 are highlighted
        with a red background which indicates that breakpoints
        have been set on these 2 lines.
        You can set a breakpoint by clicking with either
        the left mouse button on the line number for the
        breakpoint.
        You can clear a breakpoint by clicking again on the
        same line number.

    <h2>Using the breakpoint pop-up menu</h2>

    <p>
        If you click with the right mouse button on a line number the
        breakpoint menu will pop up.
        To the right you can see the breakpoint menu.
        You could use the menu to set or drop a single breakpoint
        by right clicking on a particular line.
        You can also select "Drop all breakpoints" to wipe them all out
        at once.
        Realistically only the "Drop all breakpoints" is tempting, since a
        left click with set or clear a single breakpoint more easily
        than using the menu.
        There is also an "ignore" option in case you read the menu and
        decide you don't want to change any breakpoints.
