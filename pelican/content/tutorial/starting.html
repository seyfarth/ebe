    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Starting ebe</h1>
       <h2> Basics </h2>
       <p>
          First ebe needs to be in a directory contained in the PATH
          environment variable.
          In addition for ebe to use any language other than English, the
          file "ebe_xx.qm" where xx is a 2 letter language code also needs
          to be in the same directory as the ebe program.
          If you have started ebe from the shell script created by the
          Linux/OS X install script, the actual program, named "ebe.exe",
          and the ".qm" files will be in a subdirectory named "ebe.d".
        </p>
        <p>
          Ebe will read a file named ".ebe.ini" from the current directory
          when it starts to retrieve settings from the last time it was
          executed.
          The settings can be edited using the Edit-&gt;Edit Settings menu
          option.
          The file format is also simple enough to edit with a text editor.
       </p>

       <h2> Starting without a file name </h2>
       <p> Assuming that ebe is in one of the directories in the PATH
           variable, it can be started by entering "ebe" on the command line:
           <pre>
     ebe
           </pre>
           Ebe will start with an empty edit window.
           You can then enter source code and use the File-&gt;Save as menu
           option to save the file before running it.
        </p>

        <h2> Starting with a source file name </h2>

        <p>
          You can enter the name of the source file on the command line
          after "ebe":
          <pre>
    ebe hello.asm
          </pre>
          In this case ebe will load "hello.asm" in the source window.
        </p>

        <h2> Starting with a project file name </h2>

        <p>
          An ebe project file is simply a text file with file names:
          one per line.
          The name of a project file must end with the extension ".ebe".
          Simply add the project file name to the command line:
          <pre>
    ebe hello.ebe
          </pre>
          Here the project file is named "hello.ebe" and will contain
          a collection of file names.
          Each of the files in "hello.ebe" will be opened in a
          separate tabbed subwindow in the source frame.
          There can be non source files in a project file which makes
          it convenient to manage a data file as part of a project.
