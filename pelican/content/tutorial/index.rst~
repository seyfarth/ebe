Ebe is designed to be easy to learn.  The editor key combinations
are the defaults from the Qt menu system which happen to match the
expectations of users on most computerst.  Control is used on
Windows and Linux and the Apple key is used under OS X.

Another useful feature is the inclusion of tooltips.  Whenever the
cursor lingers on a part of ebe, a tooltip will pop up.  They are
intended to remind you of special things that are possible which might
be hard to remember.

Finally there are help windows which can be viewed by selecting
"Help" from the menu and then selecting one of the help windows. 
For people experienced with running debuggers, the help windows might
contain sufficient information and could be a quicker way to learn
about ebe than studying this tutorial.

My suggestion is to start by reading the introduction and then try to
do some programming with ebe.  Return to the tutorials whenever
you find something confusing.  Perhaps it will be so easy that you
won't need to read all these.  In case you do need to read the
tutorials, I think it would be better to read enough to target solving
an immediate need and focus more on your programming.
