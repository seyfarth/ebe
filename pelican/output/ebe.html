        <p>Ebe is an integrated development designed to support Assembly
Language.  After teaching assembly language one semester where the
students and I depended on using gdb for debugging, I wanted a better
solution.  I tried ddd and a few IDEs, but they all suffered from
the fact that yasm doesn't provide data type information to gdb.  I
started trying to write a debugger in python and decided dbe was a nice
name for a debugger.  Since dbe had a source code window which
supported nearly all that was needed in an editor, it became apparent
that dbe was almost a development environment.  So I decided to
expand it to be an IDE and I had to pick a name for a development
environment.  The name ebe was too hard to resist since it already
means extraterrestrial biological entity.  But just to satisfy my
sense of fairness, I can claim that is stands for easy beginner
environment.  This also explains the alien icon.  I drew the
alien icon based on what I have read of little green men.  I
hope I haven't made an icon too much like something someone has
trademarked.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-can-ebe-do">
<h2>What can ebe do?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell ebe supports program development in C, C++, Fortran and
Assembly.  It was designed to support Assembly and I needed to be
able to build programs with C functions, so C and C++ were
important.  Adding Fortran was easy, so why not?  The Qt
version of ebe runs on Linux, OS X and Windows.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-do-you-get-ebe">
<h2>How do you get ebe?</h2>
<p>You can get ebe from <a class="reference external" href="http://qtebe.sourceforge.net">http://qtebe.sourceforge.net</a>.
There are installation packages for Ubuntu, Slackware and Windows.
At this time support for OS X consists of instructions on how
to download the source code and compile ebe.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-get-help-with-ebe">
<h2>How do you get help with ebe?</h2>
<p>There is a <a class="reference external" href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> which should be enough to get started.
There are also tooltips and help inside the program.
Looking through the menus will give some ideas and will show
some keyboard shortcuts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-report-problems-with-ebe">
<h2>How do you report problems with ebe?</h2>
<p>You can use the <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/p/qtebe/tickets/">ticket system</a> on the ebe sourceforge site to report
problems with ebe.
You can also email me as <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ray.seyfarth&#64;gmail.com">ray.seyfarth&#64;gmail.com</a>.</p>
