    <div class="section" id="starting-and-finishing">
<h2>Starting and Finishing</h2>
<p>It is generally best to start at the start. I also think it is important to be
also finish whatever you start. Both these are generally easy but there are a
few programs (notably vi) which can be difficult to finish.</p>
<p>Start ebe by typing in &quot;ebe&quot; in a terminal window. Ebe will start and will
display a collection of sub-windows and toolbars in the ebe window. The main
sub-window is the source window which can hold several tabs with separate
source files. There are also a collection of sub-windows which are &quot;dock&quot;
widgets. Initially the dock widgets are shown to the left. The dock widgets
can be moved around, stacked to make tabbed dock widgets and even moved to be
independent windows. Likewise the toolbars can be dragged around.</p>
<p>There is a View menu option is ebe which can be used to select/deselect dock
widgets to customize ebe's appearance. Ebe saves its configuration is the file
&quot;.ebe.ini&quot; in the current directory which allows you to keep your custom
settings for a project just like you want it.</p>
<p>When you first start ebe it should look like the picture below.</p>
<img alt="" src="ebe_start.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>This layout is not ideal and is intentionally cramped to fit smaller screens.
Most likely you will want to make the ebe window larger and drag the &quot;channel&quot;
between the dock widgets and the source window to make the dock widgets
wider. There are also about 6 dock widgets which are not shown initially
which could be valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exiting-ebe">
<h2>Exiting ebe</h2>
<p>You can exit ebe from the File menu exit option which also shows a shortcut
using the keyboard (Ctrl-Q or Apple-Q). You can also use the door icon, <img alt="door" src="quit.png" />
from the left-most toolbar to exit using the mouse.  Equally you can use the
&quot;X&quot; or whatever your system has in the title bar for killing a program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ebe-subwindows">
<h2>Ebe Subwindows</h2>
<div class="section" id="source-window">
<h3>Source Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_source.png" style="width: 700px;" />
<p>Here we have shown the ebe main window without the dock widgets. This
shows the source window and the toolbars. The code template toolbar
(on the right) is too big to see entirely in this picture.</p>
<p>The source window is where you will enter your code. It along with
the main window is also the hub of the application. It has the menu
system where you can open files and perform a range of editing
operations. There are several toolbars including the debug toolbar
which has 5 buttons used in debugging:</p>
<img alt="" class="align-left" src="ebe.png" />
<p>The run button (green alien) builds your program and starts
it in the debugger. It continues to run until it hits a
breakpoint. The next line to be executed will be displayed
with a light blue-green background.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-left" src="next.png" />
<p>The next button is used to execute one line of source code in
the debugger. It shows an arrow going over some code which
means that it does not step into called functions. The
highlighting will switch to the new line. Next will stay in
the same function (or subroutine for Fortran).</p>
<img alt="" class="align-left" src="step.png" />
<p>The step button executes one line of source code, but it will
step into a function if the line contains a function call.
Here the arrow shows going into some code. You probably don't
want to step into system library functions.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-left" src="continue.png" />
<p>Continue will execute code until it reaches another
breakpoint. This time the arrow indicates starting from here
and keeping on going. This can be useful to rapidly execute a
section of code which works properly.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-left" src="stop.png" />
<p>This button ends the debugging session and removes the
highlight from the last highlighted line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-window">
<h3>Data Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_data.png" style="width: 200px;" />
<p>The data window is pretty boring at the start. In general it will
display program variables in 3 categories: globals, locals and parameters.
It displays parameters and local variables for functions when it enters them,
so initially it has none to display.</p>
<p>The globals, locals and parameters will be displayed for languages
which have provided adequate debug data. Assembly functions will show
no local variables, while C/C++ and Fortran will. There is an assembly data
window which will show globals for assembly language and allow you to define
data based on addresses displayed in the various windows.
There is also a stack frame window which can be used to monitor assembly
parameters and local variables.</p>
<p>The red triangle is a collapse/expand button.  If it points up, it is a
collapse button which would hide all the variables under the category.
Likewise a downward pointing triangle would expand a category or variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="register-window">
<h3>Register Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_registers.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The register window displays the current state of the general purpose
registers at each point where control has returned to ebe from the
debugger. Thus when you single-step through your code with with Next
or Step the current values will be fetched from the debugger and
displayed.</p>
<p>This window is probably useful only for assembly language. For higher
level languages the data window should suffice. Many assembly
instructions change the values of registers so seeing these registers
live during a debug session is critical.</p>
<p>There are 2 format choices available for the general purpose registers:
decimal and hexadecimal. You can select a format by right clicking on
a register name and selecting a format from the popup list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="floating-point-register-window">
<h3>Floating Point Register Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_fp_registers.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The floating point register window displays the current state of the
floating point registers at each point where control has returned to
ebe from the debugger. Thus when you single-step through your code
with with Next or Step the current values will be fetched from the
debugger and displayed.</p>
<p>This window is probably useful only for assembly language. For higher
level languages the data window should suffice. Many assembly
instructions change the values of registers so seeing these registers
live during a debug session is critical.</p>
<p>The common format choices for the floating point registers are float
(32 bits) and double (64 bits). There are also formats matching the
SSE and AVX instruction sets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terminal-window">
<h3>Terminal Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_terminal.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The standard input and standard output streams for programs being
debugged are piped to the terminal window. This means that printf and
cout results will show up in the window and the user will need to type
in the terminal window to satisfy scanf and cin statements. Ebe will
force all output to be immediately displayed which is not the normal
pattern for C/C++. In C if you don't end an output line with a
new-line character the printing is delayed until you print the
new-line. In ebe it is immediate. Also all inputs are handled using
the &quot;Input&quot; text input box. You can use Control-D (or C or Z) in the
input box to send an &quot;end of file&quot; into the program being debugged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-window">
<h3>Project Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_project.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>It is possible to use ebe without a project as long as the program
consists of one source file. If you need multiple source files you
will need a project file. You can also include data files in a project
if desired. A project file is a file with the extension &quot;ebe&quot; and
consists of a series of file names - one per line. Any file with know
extensions like &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.asm&quot; are compiled when you click the run
button. Files with unknown extensions are assumed to be data files and
are ignored when rebuilding the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="console-window">
<h3>Console Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_console.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The console window gives you direct access to the gdb debugger while
you are running a program in ebe. You can observe the interaction
between ebe and gdb while debugging. You can also type in gdb commands
in the text box at the bottom of the console window.</p>
<p>Most people will have little need for the console window and it is not
displayed until selected using the View menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backtrace-window">
<h3>Backtrace Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_backtrace.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The bactrace window shows the results of executing the gdb backtrace
command after each step in execution of your program. This shows
information from the runtime stack showing all function calls and
parameters currently active in the program.</p>
<p>Most people will have little need for the backtrace window and it is
not displayed until selected using the View menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="toybox-window">
<h3>Toybox Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_toybox.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The toybox window allows you to quickly evaluate expressions in either
C/C++ or Fortran. You can define some variables in the top table by
entering names, types and values. Then you can define expressions in
the bottom table and click the &quot;do it&quot; button to the right of an
expression to evaluate the expression. Ebe will build a test program,
compile and execute it, capturing its output in the result box. Then
you can select appropriate formats for your data.</p>
<p>The toybox is great for experimenting in a language and is particularly
useful in the beginning. It can be pretty slow writing programs and
executing them to see what the compiler does with your code. The
toybox is easy, flexible and quick. It is shown at the start to tempt
you to try it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bit-bucket-window">
<h3>Bit Bucket Window</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="start_bitbucket.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>The bit bucket window allows you to experiment with a variety of
low-level features. You can execute all the unary and binary operators
available in C/C++. This means that you can select the binary bit
operations and perform operations like left shift and exclusive or.
There is even a rotate operator added for assembly programmers.</p>
<p>It does integer conversions and math step by step so that you can learn
how to do these yourself. The float conversions include conversion
from internal format into numeric form and also from numeric form into
the internal representation of floats. This too is done step by step
so that you can learn the steps.</p>
<p>Most people will have little need for the bit bucket and it is not
displayed until selected using the View menu. It is directed more
towards assembly programmers but it can also be useful for C/C++ and
Fortran programmers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="entering-a-program">
<h2>Entering a program</h2>
<img alt="" src="source_namespace.png" style="width: 680px;" />
<p>You can simply type in the text for a new program in the editor of
the source window. Using the arrow keys, return and backspace are
almost sufficient for getting started. Ebe has a word completion
facility which tries to help you type by offering possible completions
for partial words. Above you can see the source window with ebe
offering to complete the C++ keyword namespace after entering &quot;n&quot;.
Simply press the enter key to complete the word with the selected
completion. The keyword using was completed after entering 2 letters,
so it is quick to enter &quot;using namespace std;&quot; in ebe.</p>
<div class="section" id="saving-the-source-file">
<h3>Saving the source file</h3>
<img alt="" src="file_menu.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>It is necessary to have a name for your source file in order to run the
program. Once ebe knows the name of your file it will automatically
save the file each time your click on the Run button. To save your
file file either click on the File menu option or press Alt-F (or
Apple-F). This will bring up the File menu shown to the right.</p>
<p>You would then select &quot;Save as&quot; to save the file and give it a new
name. The &quot;Save&quot; option will work just as well if the name is not
already known.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="save_as.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>To the right you can see the file save menu after typing in
&quot;sample.cpp&quot;. Pressing the Save button will then save the source code
in &quot;sample.cpp&quot;. Following this the Run button will automatically save
the file and attempt to build a program named &quot;sample&quot; using the &quot;g++&quot;
command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-your-program">
<h3>Running your program</h3>
<p>You can compile and run your program by clicking on the Run
button, <img alt="run_button" src="ebe.png" />.
However you will usually want to set one of more
breakpoints in your code before running it.</p>
<img alt="" src="sample_source_9.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<p>A breakpoint is a point in your program where the debugger
will pause the execution of your program. In the program above
you can see that the line number for line 9 has a red
background which indicates that a breakpoint has been set on
line 9. You can set or clear a breakpoint by clicking (right
or left) on the line number.</p>
<p>Also you can see that line 9 is highlighted with a
blue-green background. This is a result of clicking the Run
button which saved the file, ran g++, and started running the
program in the debugger, gdb. When gdb reached the breakpoint
it stopped and ebe highlighted line 9. At this point line 9
has not yet been executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-local-variables">
<h3>Viewing local variables</h3>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="sample_data_9.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>When the debugger stopped execution ebe found the names and
types of the local variables and displayed them in the data
window. You can see that variable a has the value 32767 when
the program paused at line 9. Recall that by default C++ local
variables are placed on the stack and are not initialized upon
entering a function. Thus something occurred prior to main
being called which resulted in 32767 being placed on the stack
at the location currently occupied by a.</p>
<p>&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;source stopped at line 11&quot;
src=&quot;sample_source_11.png&quot;&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="single-stepping-though-your-program">
<h3>Single-stepping though your program</h3>
<img alt="" src="sample_source_11.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="sample_terminal_11.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p>Clicking on the Next button, <img alt="next_button" src="next.png" />,
will execute one line
of code. Executing the cout statement on line 9 may on some
computers actually print the prompt, but under Linux it
probably won't actually print until the cin statement on line
10 is executed which forces the printing to occur. However in
ebe the debugged program's output is always immediately
displayed. Above you see the source window after clicking Next
twice. To the right you see the terminal window with 2 numbers
entered for a and b.</p>
<p>Pressing return in the terminal text input box will complete
the cin statement. At that time ebe will highlight line 11 and
the new values for a and b will be displayed in the data
window.</p>
<img alt="" src="sample_source_11b.png" style="width: 800px;" />
<img alt="" src="sample_data_11.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="sample_data_12.png" style="width: 400px;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-c">
<h3>Setting c</h3>
<p>To the right we see the data window after executing line 11
(clicking Next). The value for c has been set to the sum of a
and b.</p>
<img alt="" class="align-right" src="sample_terminal_13.png" style="width: 400px;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="printing-the-result">
<h3>Printing the result</h3>
<p>After executing line 12 (one more click on Next), the terminal window
shows the result of cout.</p>
